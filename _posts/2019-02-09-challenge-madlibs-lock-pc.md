### Madlibs Challenge
Over at E-Learning Heroes they had [a challenge to use Madlibs](https://community.articulate.com/articles/using-mad-libs-to-create-elearning-word-games?page=1) in an elearning activity. With the original Madlibs, players choose different word types (e.g. adjective, animal) and insert them into sentences without knowing the larger context.

I immediately had a flash when I saw the challenge. I could use it to make a funny little activity about leaving your computer unlocked at work. 

### Security 101
Locking your screen when you step away from your desk is cybersecurity 101. It might be a low hanging fruit in the security world but it turns up again and again at training.

#### Most training includes:
- instructions and regulations not to leave computers unlocked
- spot the mistake activities
- verbal reminders at meetings
- officially sanctioned or vigilante penalties to offenders

The **instructions and regulations** might work with employees who don't like to break rules. Most people seem to zone out and go *"straightforward I know how to do that."*

The **spot the mistake activities** might help people notice when they are in the wrong.

The **verbal reminders**, well people are forgetting to do it. Maybe it helps form the habit?

The **embarrassing penalties** meted out by colleagues? Let's say posting embarrassing status updates or changing their wallpaper or buying the team donuts. [It's popular and social pressure works](https://www.troyhunt.com/40-inappropriate-actions-to-take/), sometimes. But there is also backlash--some employees are demotivated by these antics because they find them cruel and unfair.

### Office Antics - Lock your computer elearning activity
This activity falls into the reminder category. It uses humour and the threat of embarrassment to make a point. Hopefully people can connect the dots.

The first slide invites the learner to fill in the blanks and learn about some office antics.

In the second slide it's revealed they left their computer unlocked and the words they just filled in describe their new computer wallpaper.

![The second slide has the punch (your colleagues are probably more creative) and the reminder: Lock your screen already!](/assets/images/lockscreen2.PNG.)

There is also some info about keyboard shortcuts (i.e. a faster way to lock their screen). I don't think the actual issue is people don't have the right skills or information, that's why this is only a link for people who want it.

If I took this further I would find some info about what type of bad things have actually happened from unlocked computers and find a way for people to share their creativity with others, maybe through Slack or other corporate instant messaging.
