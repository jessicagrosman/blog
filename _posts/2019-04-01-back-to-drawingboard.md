I completed an [Elearning Heroes Elearning Challenge to use gifs](https://community.articulate.com/articles/using-animated-gifs-in-elearning). I reused my example from the week before. So now I have a snazzy mad libs style cybersecurity activity with gifs!

Was I lazy?

No Way!

The beauty of E-learning challenges is that you can play with an example in different contexts, with different constraints. 

The experiment pushed me to see the activity from a new perspective.

### What I changed

I mostly changed cosmetic things, the design and tone. I wanted to create something that had more of an *internet culture* vibe. 

The changes let me see the design and space in the slide in ways I was blind to before.

- I was asking the user to fill out way too much information. I cut some out.
- I played with how few instructions I could put on the slide. We put instructions out of habit or sometimes as a band-aid for half-thought out ideas. But apps and online services are moving away from on-screen instructions. I want to push my elearning that way too.

### Feedback and Change in Elearning Development

These changes were easy because the activity felt less *precious* than it did last week. I already new it worked.

**I had a neutral openess towards the final outcome. I could substantially edit the activity and take it to new places.**

I am usually open to changes and feedback during projects. Playing like this gives hands-on practice on what iterative development could look like. The project seemed to breathe on it's own.

In the first version it was what can I do to make this work. I think this is what lean practitioners would call a minimally viable product. Then this second example takes it further.

**Honestly, I had more fun editing than I did creating.**
