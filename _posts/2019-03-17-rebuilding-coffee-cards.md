I have been rebuilding [Melissa Milloway's Educational Coffee Cards](http://work.melslearninglab.com/coffee-roast-cards/story_html5.html). It's an Articulate Storyline project that presents information with a bit of flair. The coffee cards have nice little details, especially in the interactions, that give the project a polished user-friendly look.

### Emulate the greats
At work I am the only person working on these types of projects so I don't get to see how other work very often. I enjoy following Melissa Milloway because she works at the intersection of learning experiences, User Experience (UX) design and technology. I think she is on a quest shed some of elearning's negative baggage.

Melissa brings a level of attention to detail in graphic design and UX that I wanted to learn from.

I don't know Melissa Milloway, but I have the impression she is really generous. She shows her work on her website and LinkedIn, as well as providing storyline files for download and tutorials. 

_*Ok, Fangirl fawning over*_

Melissa had [written about the  Coffee Cards project](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/heres-how-i-made-educational-coffee-roast-cards-melissa-milloway/) and [shared a storyline file for a similar project](http://design-system.melslearninglab.com/storyline/patterns/educational-cards/), so I could really get under the hood and dig in to her design. 

*Coffee cards* looks simple, but the simplicity comes from a lot of detailed, finessed design: triggers, motion paths, animations, javascript and deft use of the timeline go into this project. 

I spent a lot of time as I worked wondering about her workflow. Always a good thing because it made me reflect on mine too!

### E-learning Development take-aways

- Melissa makes prototypes of the UI in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) first. It's a really good idea. Adobe Xd is free and you can export elements in png at the end. 

- Working on the design outside of Storyline gave me time to focus on colours and graphics in a way I usually don't. There are a bunch of benefits. First, it is easier to manipulate graphics in Xd than in Storyline. Second, I was focused on the design, instead of what usually happends: tinkering with the look as I work on interactions in Storyline. It saves time in the long run and makes developing in Stroyline less frustrating.

- In Storyline, the timeline is mostly used to make seamless intros and outros. The timeline is often paused much of the time then restarted by triggers.

- I usually steer clear of the animation tab. This project showed me that you can make nice things with animation and motion paths, if you use a light hand. The project has fades and motion paths that last .25 seconds. Objects are nudged in hovers by 3px. 

- Use javascript to change the background of the page so it looks like it's in full screen. It's another example of a small tweak that adds polish to the whole project. I could only get the javascript to work with the classic player. 


### Here's my example

![My version: Company Values Cards](/blog/assets/images/values-cards-main.png)

**Try my version: [Company Values Cards](http://jessicagrosman.ca/values-cards/story_html5.html)**

I used [Gsoft's company values](https://www.gsoft.com/en/career/) for the cards. It's Montreal software company that has a unique perspective on work life. I thought it could be an interesting way to show the values for onboarding training.

The color scheme is from [Magoz's website](https://magoz.is/), as [highlighted on Canva's blog](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/). I streamlined the design a bit: removing the icons on the cards and the spin from the close icon.

### Cards in elearning 

Overall, the cards offer a flexible outline to present chunks of information. It's an updated version of the tabbed view that is very popular in elearning.
