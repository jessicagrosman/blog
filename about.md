## Hello. I'm Jessica Grosman. I create training for a living--and I love it!

I am focused on making effective and memorable training about technology.

At work, I create elearning modules, deliver workshops, make videos and write technical documentts.

My blog is a place to reflect on training and test out different ideas and tools.

For example, I used Jeykll and GitHub to make this site.

I am also making my own images to improve my graphic design skills.
