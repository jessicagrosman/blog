## Hello. I'm Jessica Grosman. I create training for a living--and I love it!

I am focused on making effective and memorable training about technology.

At work, I create elearning courses, deliver workshops, make videos and write technical documents.

My blog is a place to reflect on training and test out different ideas and tools.

For example, I am making my own images to improve my graphic design skills. 

Not to mention I learned two new tools: Jeykll and GitHub pages to make this site.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicagrosman/).
