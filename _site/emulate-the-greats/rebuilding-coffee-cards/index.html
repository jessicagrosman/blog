<p>I have been rebuilding <a href="http://work.melslearninglab.com/coffee-roast-cards/story_html5.html">Melissa Milloway’s Educational Coffee Cards</a>. It’s an Articulate Storyline project that presents information with a bit of flair. The coffee cards have nice little details, especially in the interactions, that give the project a polished user-friendly look.

<h3 id="emulate-the-greats">Emulate the greats</h3>
<p>At work I am the only person working on these types of projects so I don’t get to see how other work very often. I enjoy following Melissa Milloway because she works at the intersection of learning experiences, User Experience (UX) design and technology. I think she is on a quest to shed some of elearning’s negative baggage.</p>

<p>Melissa brings a level of attention to detail in graphic design and UX that I wanted to learn from.</p>

<p>I don’t know Melissa Milloway, but I have the impression she is really generous. She shows her work on her website and LinkedIn, as well as providing storyline files for download and tutorials.</p>

<p><em>*Ok, Fangirl fawning over*</em></p>

<p>Melissa had <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/heres-how-i-made-educational-coffee-roast-cards-melissa-milloway/">written about the  Coffee Cards project</a> and <a href="http://design-system.melslearninglab.com/storyline/patterns/educational-cards/">shared a storyline file for a similar project</a>, so I could really get under the hood and dig in to her design.</p>

<p><em>Coffee cards</em> looks simple, but the simplicity comes from a lot of detailed, finessed design: triggers, motion paths, animations, javascript and deft use of the timeline go into this project.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time as I worked wondering about her workflow. Always a good thing because it made me reflect on mine too!</p>

<h3 id="e-learning-development-take-aways">E-learning development take-aways</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Melissa makes prototypes of the UI in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a> first. It’s a really good idea. Adobe Xd is free and you can export elements in png at the end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on the design outside of Storyline gave me time to focus on colours and graphics in a way I usually don’t. There are a bunch of benefits. First, it is easier to manipulate graphics in Xd than in Storyline. Second, I was focused on the design, instead of what usually happends: tinkering with the look as I work on interactions in Storyline. It saves time in the long run and makes developing in Stroyline less frustrating.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Storyline, the timeline is mostly used to make seamless intros and outros. The timeline is often paused much of the time then restarted by triggers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I usually steer clear of the animation tab. This project showed me that you can make nice things with animation and motion paths, if you use a light hand. The project has fades and motion paths that last .25 seconds. Objects are nudged in hovers by 3px.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use javascript to change the background of the page so it looks like it’s in full screen. It’s another example of a small tweak that adds polish to the whole project. I could only get the javascript to work with the classic player.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/javascript_backgrounds.png" alt="Comparison of story project with and without javascript" /></p>

<h3 id="heres-my-example">Here’s my example</h3>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/values-cards-main.PNG" alt="Company Values Cards" /></p>

<p><strong>Try my version: <a href="http://jessicagrosman.ca/values-cards/story_html5.html">Company Values Cards</a></strong></p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.gsoft.com/en/career/">Gsoft’s company values</a> for the cards. It’s Montreal software company that has a unique perspective on work life. I thought it could be an interesting way to show the values for onboarding training.</p>

<p>The color scheme is from <a href="https://magoz.is/">Magoz’s website</a>, as <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/">highlighted on Canva’s blog</a>. I streamlined the design a bit: removing the icons on the cards and the spin from the close icon.</p>

<h3 id="cards-in-elearning">Cards in elearning</h3>

<p>Overall, the cards offer a flexible outline to present chunks of information. It’s an updated version of the tabbed view that is very popular in elearning.</p>

<p>Cards are big in web design because they look good on most devices. I made this in storyline so it is not as responsive as html and css, but it looked pretty good on my smartphone.</p>
