        <p>I made a learning activity about choosing strong, complex passwords at work. It’s part of an <strong>E-learning Heroes’ challenge</strong> about web objects. I used the web objects to include activities that give feedback about password choices. I had a bit of trouble technically but learned new things about iframes.

<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The reality is bad passwords let bad people do bad things: steal your identity, break into company’s infrastructure, etc.</p>

<p>Cyber Security Awareness Training still covers passwords because people still choose bad passwords.</p>

<p>A coworker had always told me she had a password that was hard to guess. She was sure of it. One day she went home without an important file and I had to log in to her computer. Her password was <em>BOYFRIENDSNAME123.</em></p>

<p>I was gobsmacked.</p>

<p>Password training is difficult because we are talking about preventative measures and  changing habits. And really who likes passwords anyways?</p>

<p>Most training gives information about password strength and complexity: guidelines and things to avoid. But information alone rarely changes behaviour.</p>

<p>I have thought that interactions focused on increasing feedback could help change password choosing behaviour and habits.</p>

<p>I had two idea to include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Password strength analyzer</li>
  <li>Pwned Password.</li>
</ol>

<p>To really solidify good password making habits, I think we would need to look at how to roll out password managers and help people book time to set them up.</p>

<p><em>(If only they would actually listen to us about password managers! They really do make using the internet less frustrating!)</em></p>

<h3 id="password-strength-analyzer">Password Strength Analyzer</h3>

<p>I noticed during a company wide password manager implementation that people pay  some attention to password strength meters. Participants let out satisfied exclamations when their passwords were evaluated as strong.</p>

<p>There is some debate around password strength analyzers. Security experts argue they  do not accurately calculate complexity.</p>

<p>For example, an analyzer might evaluate that <em>Passw0rd</em> is stronger than <em>bananacowgrease</em> because it includes a number and a capital letter.</p>

<p>But the reality it is actually probably easier to crack <em>Passw0rd</em> than bananacowgrease because it uses a common password and a common way to incorporate capitals and special characters.</p>

<p>For technical reasons I couldn’t use an analyzer that displayed password entropy, an estimate about how long the password would take to crack. That was the feedback I really wanted, e.g. <em>Your password would take 5 minutes to crack.</em></p>

<p>At least the one I found had a simple UI, the right tone and gave feedback about popular choices. I would love if the password analyzer evaluated people’s passwords based on the points on the <em>Dos and Don’ts slides</em>, then I wouldn’t even need to include them!</p>

<h3 id="pwned-passwords">Pwned passwords</h3>

<p><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">Pwned Passwords</a> is a project Troy Hunt, a security expert, who started <strong>Have I been Pwned?</strong> and <strong>Pwned Passwords</strong>.</p>

<p>Hunt collects information (hacked emails and passwords) from data breaches once they have now been made public. I thought the emotional resonance of realizing your password has been part of a data breach might help some people pay attention to the advice about choosing complex passwords and using a password manager.</p>

<p>Many applications use the <strong>Pwned Password API</strong> to warn their users that their password is a bad choice.</p>

<p>A consideration with this type of activity is how safe it is to send your password to the 3rd party application. I am familiar with <strong>Pwned Passwords</strong> and don’t have much worry about that. I kept the analyzer as is for this demo, but I would use a different one if this project goes further.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>With the above context swirling in my head for some time, I started the text-based story boards to plan the content. I like storyboards because it makes the actual development quicker. Check out <a href="/blog/assets/pdf/password_storyboard.pdf">the storyboard pdf</a>.</p>

<p>I also researched tabbed outlines and decided to go with one similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI0Yy1d1Fb8">a Storyline Demo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>I got hung up on some UX design this time.</p>

<p>The tabs or buttons were hard to get just right (they are still not there 100%). I especially had trouble with colours choices for different states etc. I spent a lot of time fiddling around in Storyline and using the format painter.</p>

<p>It’s stressful to play with the UI at a point when the course was already half created. There is just so much going on: layers, triggers, objects, etc.</p>

<p>I think I am going to spend a little more time working on templating the design before I dive in. I just downloaded <strong>Adobe Xd</strong> to try out.</p>

<h3 id="articulate-storyline---web-objects">Articulate Storyline - Web Objects</h3>

<p>Pwned Passwords and the analyzer are included in the training through Web Objects.</p>

<p>I am not a huge fan of this feature for public websites, but I tried it for an <a href="https://community.articulate.com/articles/using-web-objects-for-performance-support-in-e-learning">E-Learning Heroes challenge</a>. My main frustration was with how web content is displayed.</p>

<p>When I tested the links I wanted to use, 99% of the time Storyline warned me that the content had to be opened in a new browser window.</p>

<p>If you open the content in a new browser window it is essentially the same as a hyperlink with <em>target=”_blank”</em>.</p>

<p>I really didn’t want to include content in new browser windows.</p>

<h4 id="the-benefits-of-using-a-new-browser-window-are-few">The benefits of using a new browser window are few:</h4>

<p>✔ The learner can consult the document and not lose their place in the activity.</p>

<p>✖ The pop-up window might cause problems with the LMS.</p>

<p>✖ The design is not as elegant.</p>

<p>✖ The learner is – at least momentarily – leaving the world you have created.</p>

<h4 id="troubleshooting-why-your-content-wont-load-in-the-web-object">Troubleshooting why your content won’t load in the web object</h4>
<p>Many websites block the public from using their content in an iframe for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options">security reasons</a>. You can check if a site will let you insert the page into a web object in Storyline by inspecting the page with Developer Tools in Google Chrome.</p>

<ol>
  <li>To open Developer Tools, press CTRL + SHIFT + I.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Network</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter “x-frame” in the <strong>Filter</strong> box.</li>
  <li>If <strong>x-frame</strong> is set to Deny, the content will not load directly on the slide.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, making custom html pages and hosting them on our own server seems like the best option for web objects.</p>
